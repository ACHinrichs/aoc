#+Title: Day 22

Because I have a feeling what task 2 will be, this will be solved smartly.

Every on-block will be saved in an own struct. If a new on block intersects with an existing on block, there are three possibilities:
 - The existing one lies completely within the new one:
   - The old one gets replaced by the new one.
 - The new one lies completely within the old one:
   - No changes necessary, the  old one is kept
 - They intersect
   - Now at most 4 edges of one block can be inside of the other, therefor we split one of the blocks into subbocks and keep only those that are not inside the other
